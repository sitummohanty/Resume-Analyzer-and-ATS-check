Description: ATS Resume Tracker - A Streamlit App for Resume Analysis using Google's Gemini AI
             This app helps job seekers analyze their resumes against job descriptions using AI.
             It provides feedback on resume alignment, improvement suggestions, and ATS matching scores.

Development Timeline:

1. Initial Setup
   - Created virtual environment (.venv)
   - Set up requirements.txt with necessary packages
   - Configured Python environment for the project
   - Need to do brew install poppler, in mac os/windows os at system level
   - this code will work in Python 3.12 and above

2. Package Installation & Configuration
   - Installed streamlit, google-generativeai, python-dotenv, pdf2image, Pillow
   - Resolved pdf2image dependency issues (required Poppler installation)
   - Fixed virtual environment activation and package visibility issues

3. Core Functionality Development
   - Built PDF to image conversion function (input_pdf_setup)
   - Implemented Gemini AI integration (get_gemini_response)
   - Created Streamlit interface with file upload and text input
   - Added three analysis types: Resume Analysis, Improvement Suggestions, ATS Matching

4. Bug Fixes & Improvements
   - Fixed "Document stream is empty" error by reading PDF file only once
   - Updated Gemini model from "gemini-pro-vision" to "gemini-1.5-flash"
   - Resolved duplicate element key errors in Streamlit
   - Added comprehensive comments for beginner understanding

5. Code Organization
   - Structured code with clear section headers
   - Added detailed function documentation
   - Implemented error handling for file uploads
   - Created clean, readable code with educational comments

Current Features:
- PDF resume upload and processing
- Job description input
- Three types of AI-powered analysis
- Error handling and user feedback
- Beginner-friendly code documentation
